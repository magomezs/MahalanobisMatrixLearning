# MahalanobisMatrixLearning

This repository include three caffe python layers, which are used to learnt a Mahalanobis Matrix in order to compare features with the Mahalanobis distance for person re-identification.

1. data_analysis_queues.py is a python module containing the caffe layer called DataAnalysisQueues.
2. data_analysis_weighted_average.py is a python module containing the caffe layer called DataAnalysisWeightedAverage.

These two layers estimate a Mahalanobis Matrix from the features corresponging to pairs of people images.

<br />
3. triplet_data_analysis_queues.py is a python module containing the caffe layer called DataAnalysisQueues, to estimate a Mahalanobis Matrix from the features corresponding to triplets of people images.

<br />

4. connection_function.py is a python module containing the caffe layer called ConnectionFunction.<br />
   This layer can computes two different distances, Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, to compare the features corresponding    to pair of people images.
